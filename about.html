            Hi, I'm Kathryn von Grey.

        <p>I am currently a third year communications student at Georgia Tech, with a thread in design and media. I am passionate about exploring the history, cultural importance, and technology of media. The ways in which society shapes, and is in turn shaped by, different forms of media is a topic that I devote my time to studying and working with. In particular, I place most of my focus on the design elements of this field. Its creative and problem solving nature provides a whole wealth of intrigue for me, and I am excited to expand my future in this world!</p>
